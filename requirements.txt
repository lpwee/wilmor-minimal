# WiLoR-minimal dependencies
#
# INSTALLATION (workaround for chumpy build issue):
# The chumpy package has a broken setup.py that fails with modern pip.
# You must use --no-build-isolation when installing wilor-mini:
#
#   python -m venv venv
#   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
#   pip install --no-build-isolation git+https://github.com/warmshao/WiLoR-mini
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# The wilor-mini install will pull in most dependencies. The requirements
# below are for any additional packages needed.

torch<=2.5
torchvision<=0.20
opencv-python
numpy
dill
# wilor-mini installed separately due to chumpy build issue (see instructions above)
